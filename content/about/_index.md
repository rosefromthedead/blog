Hi! I'm Rose. I'm a first year CS student at the University of Bristol, and I'm
in love with Rust. I want it to take over the world some day. When I'm not
fangirling over Rust, I'm usually complaining about something else, but don't
let that fool you. A lot of stuff is actually quite cool, in my opinion.

I have a few hobby projects:
 - [kerux](https://github.com/rosehuds/kerux), a matrix server
 - [kernel](https://github.com/rosehuds/kernel), a kernel targeting aarch64 - pending name change :D
 - [boolean-parser](https://github.com/rosehuds/boolean-parser), a program for me and a friend to learn Haskell the fun way
 - [logic-graph](https://github.com/rosehuds/logic-graph) + [logicism](https://github.com/rosehuds/logicism), a combinatorial logic simulator and its ui
